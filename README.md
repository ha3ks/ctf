# CTF Writeups, Guides and Tools

This is my repository for my CTF writeups, notes and any scripting I create.

I recently passed the eJPT certification exam and have the cRTO and OSCP planned for 2022.

Creating writups and sharing knowledge is incredibly helpful for n00bs such as myself and I wish to give back to the community in a way that helps both myself and others.
